EXPERIMENT 1

The executable file *set2* is used for running the experiments.
It is generated by compiling the library *set2-lib* provided at https://osebje.famnit.upr.si/~savnik/set2-lib/set2.zip .
The file README includes the instructions for the compilation of *set2*.

PARAMETERS

// alphabet size
\sigma = 25     

// number of sets in set-trie
N = 10000,20000,40000,160000,320000         

// number of test sets
M = 10000,50000                             


FORMAT OF OUTPUT FILE RESULTS_m'V'_25_n='N'.txt        

We have two types of output files.

1) The output for the methods -m1 and -m2 (subsetExists and supersetExists).

The output files of *set2* have the following format: set='X';val='B';cnt='C' .

'X' = current test set
'B' = boolean value true|false. Result is *true* if operation succeeds and *false* otherwise.
'C' = number of nodes visited in the set-trie for completing the operation

2) The output for the methods -m3 and -m4 (getAllSubsets and getAllSupersets).

The output files of *set2* have the following format: set='X';cnt='C';sets='L' .

'X' = current test set
'C' = number of nodes visited in the set-trie for completing the operation
'L' = number of sets returned by the operation.
 

DESCRIPTION OF *SCRIPT.sh* 

Runs *set2* on the given input files for all four operations (-m1,-m2,-m3,-m4).

Example:

$ ./set2 -m2 flat-input_sigma=25_M=50000.txt < s-trie_sigma=25_n=10000.txt > RESULTS_m2_25_n=10000.txt

Invokes the operation supersetExists (-m2) on the set-trie constructed from s-trie_sigma=25_n=10000.txt for 
all test sets from flat-input_sigma=25_M=50000.txt. One line in output file RESULTS_m2_25_n=10000.txt is generated 
for each test set.
